        <p>Dear Christopher Smith</p>

        <p>We are writing to invite you for your NHS cervical screening (previously called the 'smear test').</p>

        <p>We offer screening to all women and people with a cervix, aged 25 to 64, to help prevent cervical cancer and to save lives.</p>

        <p><b>How to book your appointment</b></p>

        <p>Contact your GP surgery to book a cervical screening appointment.</p>

        <p>Some sexual health clinics also offer cervical screening. <a href="/">Contact your local sexual health clinic</a> to find out more.</p>

        <p><b>Why should I book an appointment?</b></p>

        <p>Cervical screening checks for certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). These 'high risk' types of HPV can be found in over 99% of cervical cancers.</p>

        <p>If we find one of these HPV types in your screening sample, we then check for abnormal cell changes.</p>

        <p>By finding and treating these changes early, we can prevent most cases of cervical cancer.</p>

        <p>You can get HPV the first time you have sexual contact, and you do not need to have penetrative sex to get it.</p>

        <p>You can have it even if you have had the same sexual partner for a long time or have not been sexually active for many years.</p>

        <p>You can still have HPV regardless of your sexual orientation or if you have had the HPV vaccine.</p>

        <p><b>Support if you are worried about cervical screening</b></p>

        <p>Cervical screening appointments only take 5 to 10 minutes, but you can ask for a longer appointment if you would like more time.</p>

        <p>You can also ask for a female nurse or doctor and can bring someone else in the room with you for support.</p>

        <p>During your appointment, you can ask to lie in a different position and for a smaller speculum to make the test more comfortable for you.</p>

        <p>For more information about what happens during a cervical screening appointment, HPV, and cervical cancer, <a href="/">read our online leaflet on the GOV.UK website</a>.</p>

        <p>You can also <a href="/">find advice and support on the GOV.UK website if you feel worried or need assistance attending cervical screening</a>.</p>

        <p><b>More information</b></p>

        <p>The nurse or doctor who does your screening test will tell you how and when you can expect to get your result, and they will also be told your result.</p>

        <p>Tell your GP surgery if you change your address or contact details.</p>

        <p>Speak to a GP as soon as possible if you have any of the following symptoms, regardless of your cervical screening history:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>vaginal bleeding that's unusual for you - including bleeding during or after sex, between your periods or after the menopause, or heavier periods than usual</li>
          <li>changes to your vaginal discharge</li>
          <li>pain during sex</li>
          <li>pain in your lower back, between your hip bones (pelvis), or in your lower tummy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Learn more about <a href="/">NHS cervical screening and HPV</a>, including what happens at your appointment and how to book.</p>

        <p>If you have any concerns or questions about cervical screening, speak with a GP</p>

        <p><a href="/">Read about how we use and protect your information</a>, or <a href="/">opt out</a>.</p>
